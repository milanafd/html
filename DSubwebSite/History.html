		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>  Scholars say that belief in dragons probably evolved independently
		in both Europe and China, and perhaps in the Americas and Australia as
		well. How could this happen? Many have speculated about which real-life
		animals inspired the first legends. Here’s our run-down of the likeliest
		suspects.
		</br>
		Dinosaurs. Ancient people may have discovered dinosaur fossils and 
		understandably misinterpreted them as the remains of dragons. Chang Qu
		, a Chinese historian from the 4th century B.C., mislabeled such a fossil
		in what is now Sichuan Province. Take a look at a fossilized stegosaurus,
		for example, and you might see why: The giant beasts averaged 30 feet in
		length, were typically 14 feet tall and were covered in armored plates 
		and spikes for defense.	
		</br>
		The Nile Crocodile. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, Nile crocodiles may
		have had a more extensive range in ancient times, perhaps inspiring 
		European dragon legends by swimming across the Mediterranean to Italy
		or Greece. They are among the largest of all crocodile species, with
		mature individuals reaching up to 18 feet in length—and unlike most
		others, they are capable of a movement called the “high walk,” in 
		which the trunk is elevated off the ground. A giant, lumbering croc?
		Might be easy to mistake for a dragon.
