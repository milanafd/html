		<h2>Gaming</h2>
		<p> If there is a book out there on the history of video game characters, 
		there has to be a chapter devoted to dragons. Dragons in gaming emerged 
		as early as the game Atari Adventure in 1979, and the two have become 
		synonymous. Could it be the developers’ culture, what the dragons symbolize, 
		or because they’re just plain awesome?
    </br>
        Whatever the reason, dragons found their way into gaming and took it to 
		another level. They have turned out to be the best sidekicks and the most 
		epic bosses. Whether it was fighting Hydus, the Sea Dragon, in Shadow of 
		the Colossus, getting mileage out of the blue and pink dragons from Golden
		Axe, or being awestruck by the Mortal Kombat logo, dragons managed to be 
		the most fun and the most memorable aspects of video games. </p>
