		<h2>Fantasy</h2>
		<p> Dragons are popular creatures, particularly in epic high fantasy.
		If you pick up a fantasy book at random, I’d say the chance of you 
		encountering a dragon at some point during that book are high. In fact,
		doing a brief and highly unscientific survey of my fantasy shelf, I’d 
		say about 15% of them involve dragons in some way (and i’m sure if I 
		read exclusively epic fantasy that percentage would be higher).
		</br> Personally, I’m not someone that actively seeks out dragons, 
		but I always enjoy a well-wrought dragon when I encounter one.

        The question is, when there are so many dragons out there, how do 
        fantasy authors make their dragons feel fresh and interesting? 
        How do they avoid presenting a beast that’s just a forgettable, 
        tired cliché, and instead present a creature that is real and 
        tangible and compelling? A creature that gives even jaded 
        readers that feeling of wonder and delight? </p>
