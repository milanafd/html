		<h2>Eastern Dragons</h2>
		<p> The Oriental Dragon (also known as the Eastern Dragon) is another one of
		the world's most commonly known dragons. They are found in folklore, mythology
		, and religion all throughout East Asia. These dragons all symbolize different
		things. Although the European dragons were known to have terrorized people and
		to have been evil, this was not the case for the Oriental dragons. These dragons
		were said to been guardians. They were the supposed protectors of heaven. They
		also guarded the good of the people and royalty to maintain good leadership for
		the people. They were also said to have been the protectors and controllers of
		both the Earth's elements and its weather, such as the wind and the rain.
        </br>
		Although the appearances of the Oriental dragons are slightly different throughout
		East Asia, they are all very similar. Most of these dragon's appearances are based
		off that of the Chinese dragon. In Chinese folklore and mythology, the Chinese
		dragon's bodies consisted of parts of several different real-life animals.
