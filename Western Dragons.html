		<h2>Western Dragons</h2>
		<p> The European dragon is a legendary creature in folklore and mythology
		among the overlapping cultures of Europe. The Roman poet Virgil in his
		poem Culex lines 163-201,[1] describing a shepherd having a fight with
		a big constricting snake, calls it "serpens" and also "draco", showing
		that in his time the two words probably could mean the same thing.
		In and after the early Middle Ages, the European dragon is typically
		depicted as a large, fire-breathing, scaly, horned, lizard-like creature
		; the creature also has leathery, bat-like wings, four legs, and a long,
		muscular prehensile tail. Some depictions show dragons with one or more
		of: feathered wings, crests, ear frills, fiery manes, ivory spikes
		running down its spine, and various exotic decorations.
		</br>
		In folktales, dragon's blood often contains unique powers, keeping them
		alive for longer or giving them poisonous or acidic properties. The 
		typical dragon in Christian culture protects a cavern or castle filled
		with gold and treasure. An evil dragon is often associated with a great
		hero who tries to slay it, and a good one is said to give support or 
		wise advice. Though a winged creature, the dragon is generally to be 
		found in its underground lair, a cave that identifies it as an ancient
		creature of earth.
