		<h2>Litrature</h2>
		<p>Ancient, beautiful and undeniably powerful, dragons in their most common
		depictions have helped characterize the fantasy world and lend impressive 
		mythological grandeur to the tales that feature them. Dragons are an 
		attention-grabbing component of hero myths in particular, where there has 
		been a pervasive attitude that the defeat of a dragon is a way of proving 
		one’s mettle, that a dragon-like figure or idea must be ‘conquered’ in 
		order to attain a ‘prize’ (usually treasure, or virtue personified in the
		figure of a maiden).</p>
